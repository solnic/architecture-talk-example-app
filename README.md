# architecture-talk-example-app

This is a sample "application" that I used as an example in ["Architecture. The reclaimed years"](https://speakerdeck.com/solnic/krug-architecture-the-reclaimed-years) talk, presented at our awesome [KRUG](https://www.meetup.com/Krakow-Ruby-Users-Group/) meetup. This app is useless, doesn't do anything real, its purpose is to show how easy it is to set things up using [dry-system](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system) gem as the underlying architecture.

You'll find 3 branches in this repository:

- `app-setup-1` - initial setup
- `app-setup-2` - adds web front-end using roda
- `app-setup-3` - adds CLI front-end using hanami-cli
